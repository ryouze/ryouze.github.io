I hold an M.A. in [Language, Mind, Technology](https://anglistyka.amu.edu.pl/en/for-candidates/full-time-ma-programmes/language-mind-technology) from Adam Mickiewicz University. This interdisciplinary program combined linguistics with computer science, cognitive science, and AI to study language using both theoretical and experimental methods.

For over three years, I worked as a researcher on the [2020/37/B/HS2/04161](https://prodis-opus19.github.io/) project, where I built and trained a [first-of-its-kind phoneme-level GPT language model for predicting surprisal in Polish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10112).

During that time, I also developed a CI-based survey extraction pipeline, a native C++ GUI CSV editor, a wrapper around Whisper for automatic speech recognition, and a CI-integrated tracker for monitoring transcription verification across the team. I created a custom web-based GUI used by participants during the collection of a [high-quality Polish speech corpus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10112), along with a suite of internal tools for counterbalancing the corpus.

Outside of work, I am a hobbyist game developer and Linux enthusiast. I have experience building and maintaining a home server that hosts various services, including a media server. Game development, on the other hand, involves low-level performance optimization, which I find particularly rewarding.

Lastly, I also also enjoy automation and building reliable backend infrastructure. Most of my personal projects include CI/CD pipelines for fully automated native builds and cross-platform testing.
