I am a graduate of the [Language, Mind, Technology](https://anglistyka.amu.edu.pl/en/for-candidates/full-time-ma-programmes/language-mind-technology) program at Adam Mickiewicz University. I previously worked as a researcher in the [2020/37/B/HS2/04161](https://prodis-opus19.github.io/) project.

I primarily work with Python and C++, along with other general-purpose languages.
