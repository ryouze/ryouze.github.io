I am a graduate of the [Language, Mind, Technology](https://anglistyka.amu.edu.pl/en/for-candidates/full-time-ma-programmes/language-mind-technology) program at Adam Mickiewicz University.

For over three years, I worked as a researcher in the [2020/37/B/HS2/04161](https://prodis-opus19.github.io/) project, where I built and trained the [first-of-its-kind phoneme-level GPT language model for predicting surprisal in Polish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10112).

In addition, I developed a CI-based survey extraction pipeline, a native C++ GUI CSV editor, a wrapper around Whisper for automatic speech recognition, and a CI-integrated tracker for monitoring transcription verification across the team. I also developed a custom web-based GUI used by participants during data collection for a high-quality Polish speech corpus, along with a set of internal tools for counterbalancing the corpus.

Personally, I am a hobbyist game developer and a Linux enthusiast. I have experience in building and maintaining my own home server, which I use for hosting various services, including a media server. Game development is a perfect mix of low-level performance optimizations and system-level programming. I also enjoy automation and building reliable backend infrastructure, with most of my projects including fully automated native builds, cross-platform testing, and CI/CD pipelines.
