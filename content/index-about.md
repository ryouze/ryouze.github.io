I hold an M.A. in [Language, Mind, Technology](https://anglistyka.amu.edu.pl/en/for-candidates/full-time-ma-programmes/language-mind-technology) from Adam Mickiewicz University. This interdisciplinary program combines linguistics with computer science, cognitive science, and AI to study language using both theoretical and experimental methods.

Over three years as a software developer, I worked on a range of projects delivering production-grade tools and infrastructure. I built and trained a [phoneme-level GPT language model for predicting surprisal in Polish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10112) and designed a CI-based data processing pipeline to clean and transform large survey exports into analysis-ready datasets. I developed a cross-platform C++ GUI application for editing CSV data, a wrapper around Whisper for automated speech recognition, and an internal tracker for monitoring team-wide transcription progress. I also created a web-based interface for collecting high-quality Polish speech data, along with a suite of internal tools to support balanced corpus collection and team workflows.

Outside of work, I develop games and cross-platform system tools, with a focus on low-level performance optimization and efficient resource management. I have been using Linux since 2016 and built a home server that hosts multiple self-managed services, including a media server. My personal projects emphasize automation and robust backend infrastructure, with fully integrated CI/CD pipelines for automated native builds and cross-platform testing.
