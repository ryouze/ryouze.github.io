I am a student of [Language, Mind, Technology](https://anglistyka.amu.edu.pl/en/for-candidates/full-time-ma-programmes/language-mind-technology) at the Adam Mickiewicz University. I currently work as a researcher in the [2020/37/B/HS2/04161](https://prodis-opus19.github.io/) project.

My research interests include natural language processing and machine learning. I primarily use Python and C++.
