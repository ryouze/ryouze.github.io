I am a machine learning engineer with over three years of experience in software development.

I currently work at [EPR Labs](https://epr-labs.com), where I develop software and data pipelines for training, evaluating, and deploying predictive and generative machine learning models in Python.

During a three-year paid research internship with the [PRODIS project](https://prodis-opus19.github.io), I designed and maintained the full machine learning and data processing stack. My work included developing a first-of-its-kind [phoneme-level GPT model for Polish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10112), CI pipelines for survey processing, transcription QA tools, a batch ASR wrapper, and a custom web interface for data collection. I also built an internal GUI tool to monitor data collection progress.

Outside of work, I develop cross-platform tools and games in C++ and maintain a Linux home server for self-hosting.
